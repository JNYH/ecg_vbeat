ECG Image Processing challenge

A health tech company game me a challenge: 

Given a collection of ECG strip images, find the location of V-beat in each image. 

The ECG records a V-beat during a premature ventricular contraction in the heartbeat.Â 

This article explains what I did to train a machine learning model to recognise the shape of V-beat.
